Interactive text based game.

You wake up hazed after a car crash you were in. You make choices involving
your environment and other people involved in the accident. The outcome of the game
varies depending on your choices and actions.

You can launch the game by invoking start.py from main or importing it and calling it's
begin function.

Install as a package with python setup.py install to access it at any time.

For the packaged version after installing, the begin function is already imported into __init__ therefore
after importing the package simply call the function using it.

Thank you and enjoy.
