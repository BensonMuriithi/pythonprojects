This program converts string Roman numbers to integers and vice-versa.

Functions:

roman2.getint(roman_number) -> int
	returns the integral value of a Roman number supplied as a string

roman2.getroman(number) -> str
	returns an uppercase string holding the Roman representation of a number

The range of numbers supported is 1 - 3999 by both functions.
 - The correct Roman represenation of greater values requires a bar be placed
   above numbers to multiply them by a thousand. I haven't figured out a way to do
   so. If you can do please share.
