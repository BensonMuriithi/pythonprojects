This package contains functions that are meant to provide the capabilities
of Windows Powershell on the Python Shell.

Methods are called in the python fashion.
Most methods have multiple names to handle the command name differences on powershell,
cmd and other shells. ie copy()  and cp() do the same thing.

When new operations are discovered manageable in Python they'll be included asap.

If any improvements performance or otherwise they can be pointed out.
